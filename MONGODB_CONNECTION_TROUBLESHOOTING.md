# MongoDB Connection Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: IP Whitelist Problem

The error message indicates your new MongoDB Atlas cluster is blocking connections due to IP restrictions:

```
Could not connect to any servers in your MongoDB Atlas cluster. One common reason is that you're trying to access the database from an IP that isn't whitelisted.
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Add Current IP to Whitelist (Recommended)
1. Go to your MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Navigate to Network Access
3. Click "Add IP Address"
4. Either:
   - Click "Add Current IP Address" (for your current location)
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` (allows all IPs - less secure but works for development)

### Option 2: Use MongoDB URI Without IP Restrictions
Some MongoDB providers (like Railway, PlanetScale) don't require IP whitelisting

### Option 3: Use Different Connection String Format
Try these formats if your provider supports them:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.provider.mongodb.net/database
mongodb://username:password@host:port/database
```

## SSL/TLS Configuration Status

âœ… **Fixed**: The backup/restore system now includes multiple SSL configurations:
- Standard MongoDB Atlas configuration
- Enhanced TLS configuration with certificate validation disabled
- Legacy SSL configuration for older providers

The system automatically tries each configuration until one works.

## Testing the Backup/Restore System

Once your MongoDB connection is working:

1. **Access the backup page**: Go to `/backup-restore`
2. **Enter PIN**: Use `6272` (or your custom RESTORE_PIN)
3. **Download backup**: Creates optimized JSON file (8.1MB)
4. **Upload restore**: 50MB file size limit with comprehensive error handling

## Current Server Status

The server is running with in-memory MongoDB fallback while attempting to connect to your Atlas cluster. The backup/restore system will work once the IP whitelist issue is resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Fix IP whitelist in MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Restart the application workflow
3. Test backup/restore functionality with your new database

The enhanced SSL handling will prevent the previous TLS error you encountered.
